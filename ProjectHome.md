# OK, OK I'll do something about SketchUp 2014 Support ;-P #
_Seems as though I'd better get my act together and update this plugin and host it at the extensions warehouse http://extensions.sketchup.com/_

_UPDATE: First round of testing passed - there's an RBZ file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8oqOhQksyrDc0d5YVN1UUZ5cWM/edit?usp=sharing) for anyone interested in using it before the move to the extension warehouse_

  * Need to fix bug when selecting multiple copies of a component (only one gets exported)
  * Need to create some updated video tutorials
  * Document options for GUI

_See http://help.sketchup.com/en/article/38583 for installing RBZ files manually_
